Must Haves:
- Move has to be implemented move(current board, last move, timeToMove)
- It needs adhere to the schema of the MCTS algorithm
- It needs to have a name that includes your name (id-method)
- For each implemented function, a runtime complexity analysis (i.e., the
big-Oh of the function, plus an explanation for why this is so), needs to
be included in the comments above the function.
